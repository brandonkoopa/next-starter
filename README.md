# Next.js Starter Project ðŸš€

This is a starter project for a **Next.js** application with my favorite tools to get started. The setup includes **Storybook**, **Mocha**, **ESLint**, and **Jest** for testing and development.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Latest version of Next.js to build scalable server-side rendered applications.
- **React**: React 18 for building UI components.
- **Storybook**: Develop and test UI components in isolation.
- **Mocha & Chai**: Set up for running tests with Mocha and Chai for assertions.
- **ESLint**: Linting setup with React and Storybook support to keep the code clean.
- **Jest with TypeScript**: Pre-configured testing with Jest using TypeScript.

## Getting Started
